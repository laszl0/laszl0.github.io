Recently i was setting up Ubuntu 16.04 LTS on a machine and wanted to make note of how i managed to do so,
then i remembered that it would be good to make a post of it, cause last year i failed at posting.

Actually i had read a lot of things, but only bookmarked them or wrote the ideas on some paper that is lost somewhere.
I will try to gather some of it, cause i want to organize the information that i'm reading, that's one of 2017 goals anyway.

So my next post is about configuring Ubuntu 16.04 LTS on a machine.
