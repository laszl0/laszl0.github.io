Last year I managed to piece together a deep learning machine, now it got an upgrade.
And with it a new os upgrade from ubuntu 14.10 to ubuntu 16.04.

Config of the machine below.
...

The steps that worked for me to install ubuntu 16.04 lts.

1. download the ubuntu image
2. write image to usb stick
3. disable secure boot, cause otherwise lot's of problems with nvidia drivers
4. when installing, check install updates and install additional drivers
5. wait for install to complete then reboot when dialog says
6. at login screen, press ctr+alt+f1 then login with user credentials
7. purge nvidia
8. service lightdm stop
9. service gdm stop
10. add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
11. apt update
12. install nvidia-375 ( at this moment i choose this one )
13. wait for it to complete then reboot

The system will boot into a nice desktop :).
